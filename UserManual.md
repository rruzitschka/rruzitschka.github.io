## Getting Started

### Interface Overview

1. When you first open SendLog, you'll land on the main tab interface
2. The app consists of four main tabs:
   - **SendLogs**: View your completed climbs
   - **Projects**: Track routes you're working on
   - **Statistics**: Analyze your climbing data
   - **Settings**: Customize your preferences
3. To start logging your climbing achievements, navigate to the SendLogs tab and tap the "+" button

## Logging Climbs

### Recording a Send

1. From the SendLogs tab, tap the "+" button to create a new entry
2. Fill in the route details:
   - **Area**: The general climbing location (e.g., "Yosemite")
   - **Crag**: The specific wall or sector (e.g., "El Capitan")
   - **Route**: The name of the climb
   - **Grade**: Select the difficulty from the grade picker
   - **Send Type**: Choose how you completed the route (onsight, flash, redpoint, etc.)
   - **Route Type**: Select the type of route (Sport, Boulder, or Multi-Pitch)
   - **Rating**: Your personal rating of the route (1-5 stars)
   - **Date**: When you completed the climb
   - **Notes**: Any additional information you want to remember
3. Tap "Save" to add the climb to your log

### Viewing and Editing Logs

1. All your sends appear chronologically in the SendLogs tab
2. Tap on any entry to view its details
3. In detail view, you can:
   - See all information about your climb
   - Edit any fields by tapping the "Edit" button
   - Delete the log if needed (with confirmation)

### Filtering and Searching

- Use the search field to find specific entries by name, area, or crag
- Use the filter menus at the top of the SendLogs tab to narrow down your climbing logs:
  
  - **Area Filter**: Tap "Filter by Area" to select a specific climbing location
  - **Route Type Filter**: Tap "Filter by Route Type" to view only Sport, Boulder, or Multi-Pitch routes
  - **Interactive Filtering**: When you select a route type, the area filter automatically updates to show only areas with that type of climb. Similarly, when you select an area, the route type filter shows only types available in that area.
  - **Clear Filters**: Select "All Areas" or "All Route Types" to remove those filters

- Combine both filters to quickly find specific climbs (e.g., all boulder problems in a specific area)
- The filters work together - if you select an area that has no boulders, the boulder option won't appear in the route type filter

## Project Tracking

### Adding a New Project

1. Navigate to the Projects tab
2. Tap the "+" button to add a new project
3. Fill in the route details similar to a regular send log
4. The route will automatically be marked with "active" status

### Logging Attempts

1. From the Projects tab, select a project
2. Tap "Log Attempt" to record a new attempt
3. For each attempt, you can record:
   - Date of the attempt
   - High point reached
   - Detailed notes about what worked or didn't work
   - Whether you successfully completed the route

### Project Management

Projects are organized into three categories:
1. **Active Projects**: Routes you're currently working on
2. **Completed Projects**: Projects you've successfully sent
3. **Abandoned Projects**: Projects you've decided to put aside

When you complete a project:
1. Log your final successful attempt
2. Mark "Was Successful" during attempt logging
3. The project will automatically move to the "Completed" section and be added to your SendLogs

## Route Types

SendLog allows you to categorize your climbs based on their type, providing better organization and more detailed statistics.

### Route Type Categories

The app supports three main route types:

1. **Sport**: Traditional single-pitch sport climbing routes with bolted protection

### Setting Route Types
